            <p>
                I've always been interested in art and creating with my hands,
                however during my adult life I silenced those passions and
                disconnected myself from art. It was only during the pandemic that I
                rediscovered art and found my way to pottery.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first contact with pottery was in Bali, Indonesia where I learned
                about the handbuilding techniques of pinching, coiling and slab
                rolling. With those techniques I started creating vessels and
                sculptures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon after, I discovered the potter's wheel and went to Tuscany,
                Italy to aquire the abilities required to produce functional
                tablewear with the potter's wheel.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time in Italy I also learned more about the steps of
                pottery that follow the building of the pieces: Glazing and Firing.
                I've learned how to create my own glazing recipes and further
                experiment with this step of the process. 
            <p>
                I've also learn about the
                differences between reduction and oxidation fire and had the
                priviledge to experience two wood fires - which is the oldest method
                of firing clay.
                The work fired in this type of kiln takes a full day of stoking (putting wood in the kiln) in 5-10 minute intervals in order to achieve a maximum temperature of 1200 degrees, making the clay vitrify or harden into a glass.
